Chelsea,xY4Wgd2OyG4,"01:24 look at Kante's run. Playing like a number 9. He had Konate on his knee. What a player. Playing after so long and yet produced match winning display, if only Kai and Kova converted them chances. Kante is the biggest reason I believe we have a chance in Champions league agains RM and our strikers poor finsihing is the biggest reason I think we don't have a chance against RM","Kante's always been a star man. We, Liverpool, couldn't handle him. There's nothing wrong with Chelsea, you just need a striker.",the man we missed so much! NGOLO KANTE!!!!!,"Kante was out for almost half a year and on his first match after the injury giving this kind of performance is just crazy. Certainly one of the best midfielder of all time, have won Champions League, World cup, premier league etc, Class player!",Should‚Äôve won. We can‚Äôt finish. Imagine this team with a striker. Should‚Äôve had 2/3 goals tonight. We were so much better than them.,"story of our season, decent performance but no end product",It is hard to believe that Kante was out for so long ! what a player,"Impressed with the midfield three: Kova, Kante and Enzo. It was exciting to see some grimps of the classic N'golo Kante. The overall play was good, we outclassed Liverpool in every department. The familiar problem is scoring. Felix can be a great player in any team only if he works on his finishing. Overall our attack was impotent and this can be costly against teams like Real Madrid who are clinical. Next season a prolific CF is a number 1 target.","Kant√©, W.fofana, konate, the goalkeepers.. were incredible","How do you expect to win games, score a lot of goals, if Kai Havertz is your striker",Kante and Fofana did well,I'm more happy that we played well than angry that we didn't score! Imagine how this team will look without Havertz at #9 and with a good manager!,"we almost had this but positive display. Kante being back shows the difference. PL is write off, let's focus CL..... come on Chelsea ","honestly they played really well but unfortunately all goals werent counted couldve ended up with a 3:0 but good play, hopefully we keep up this performance and do even better for the RM game coming up and we win some matches in the PL",Kante is so damn good,"Team transformed by the General's return,you're a star N'golo Kante!!!‚úÖü´Ç",Oh N‚ÄôGOLO Kante I‚Äôve missed you ! ,Kante the midfield maestro ,imagine all these attacking forces and chances but with a striker who has premier league experience like Harry Kane upfront,"It's really frustrating that we can't finish these clear situations. We need to remind ourselves how to score or Madrid will wreck us. Looked better with Kante tho, I hope he won't get injured again soon.",I'm so happy to see Kante back.,Kante always giving his his,"what a performance from kante despite being out for months, not to mention that hes fasting too","I'm here to watch Kante. He is back, but Chelsea still needs a good finisher!",put the ball into the net!,"If we play like this, I think we need Timmo as we ever played",gotta admit... Kante really has a great impact on this team... It's like he was never injured.,Imagine this team next season with nkunku ,"Kante
What a perfomance","N'golo Kante played extremely well. Goes to show that Potter slept on his potential. I bet if that game had D.D Fofana on the front maybe even Aubameyeng we would have found the ball at the back of the net.

Advice to Bruno, Foolishness is doing the same thing expecting different results (change in our front 3 is needed, defence and midfield is ok)"
Chelsea,mBewRJ9CASE,Tuchel with the 10 pts in the first league matches this season save us from relegation. That's it.,"Not a Chelsea fan but it was nice to see ngolo back on the pitch.....an absolute legend of the game!
Chelsea can hold that!",What an assist by Cucurella! ,"had no patience with Tuchel ‚ùå
patience with Potter‚úÖ

Todd Boehly logic","I was in favour of us hiring Potter (though didn't want TT gone in first place), but Graham so far has shown very less in things he can control. I understand the injuries and bad luck, but the in game management is evident to all and the things we do in training can only be judged on what's on pitch. We're 11th right now and have just lost battle of mids in our own home. I know the owners want to back him, but I hope there is at least some apt contingency plan in place because this is not the Chelsea we know. And there's only straws to be grasped.

Up the Chels anyway. I hope we see better times we knew again.","Definitely Dibu the player of the match! Chelse shot 27, 8 in the target but scored 0!","What an assist from Cucurella and what a chip goal  finish from Watkins
Pure Perfection !","Mudryk finishing and ball control in the last couple of games is below par, how did the club pay that  big of an amount for a non- league standard player like him.",be grateful for Tuchel if not his points at beginning of season chelsea would've been in relegation battle,Those martinez saves are unbelievable.,The moments at 0:00 and 0:50 were fantastic! I wish Mudryk always played like that!,"Thanks to Dibu again and again, campe√≥n del mundo !",Happy to see Kante back on the field ,"Thanks for posting this. The chances were many for Chelsea, but not converted. Villa was good for the win.",Mudryk bottled it in two different occasions. He should've tried to assist,You can't argue now that he doesn't have to go,"In the midst of my sorrow and disbelief, at least am happy to see Kante back...","What a performance from Felix and mudryk they really converted themselves to the Chelsea style of play , may this losing streak continues",It's time to goooooo,"Players have to improve their finishing, not a single goal scored is shocking.",Am not a Chelsea fan but its good to see kante back,whenever i feel sad i watch chels matches for uncontrolled laughter good job cucurella ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£,Cucurella's header is the best assist I've seen in a while now,"I don't think the manager is the problem when our players can't score. Surely if you have an array of talented players they can score a goal. Good to see kante back , both kante and mudrykh had goal opportunities",What an assist from the Spanish guy,Good to see Kante back,Quality assist by Cucurella for the first goal ,"We just need a finisher cause the amount of chances we are creating is nuts 

And that mistake from cucurella was a mistake definatly but the other goal was really good by aston 

And we desperatly need that man joao for nxt season",Would say we‚Äôre inconsistent but we‚Äôre consistently losing now,"People should start to know that the problem is only Todd Boehly. I mean, Abramovich fired a lot of coaches too but the team never got this bad."
Chelsea,CokI98aEmeU,We must shift our attention to the massive game against Lyon this Thursday at Stamford Bridge and try qualify for the semi's of the UWCL. Come on you Blues! ,We lost this game but I love Chelsea Women team so much.,The back position needs some change and people with a risking mind to head forward not just messing around passing and losing the ball all the time without a vision to head forward. I think the coach should work on this and make Chelsea women's team showcase their dominance at the top of the table. They should study the way man city men play their game ‚úåÔ∏è,"When against Lyon, we were the lucky one. On this game, the mentality is so poor.",Time to bounce back blues,"I know Emma has been trying to replace Magda; she has tried the last few seasons. We need a LB, CB, CM and possibly GK very soon.",No Reiten..No win..,Better days are coming iron lions ü¶Å,Hard lucky blues,Nice game‚ù§,Nevermind.....got 1 more games... Chelsea women can do ,"The backline including the goalkeeper , poor",Don‚Äôt lose focus ladies . The league is ours to lose.!,Well get them next time definitely,So sweet,CITY !!  ü©µü©µ,"The goal keeper's kick needs to improve 
If she continues giving the balls away like that we'll obviously get to be punished by the opponents always....
Very poor kick against Lyon last week",‚ú®‚ú®,We will be back.,The ladies didn't play well at all,Sayang sekali kalah dari city,I can't believe,"Line Up

Potter and the lads need Jesus"
Chelsea,GkoKZUBvC9E,what Chelsea needs isn't capable players BUT CAPABLE LEADER WITH BRILLIANT BRAIN!,"Good good results


for Everton.","Awful subs killed the game, sitting on a 1-0 lead at the 60th min is just shameful and cowardly. The form worked really well, and in no way can I understand WHY we had to change from a well working 3-4-3 to an ill 3-5-2 midgame... as well as subbing players who has no problems playing to ones with different mentality... it's just... mid-level. This is not Chelsea mentality.",It's clear we need a new manager for next season,Potters tactics is to play untill the first goal and then park the bus. He just buried our last hopes.,I think potter missed the substitution part while learning coaching ,I was screaming at my tv when he subbed Connor for Pulisic near the 65th minute. Wtf is that? One goal and we park the bus??? What mentality is that??,"We are no longer a big club‚Ä¶ we have now accepted mediocrity and this is our level‚Ä¶ that potter is still in a job after all the pain I have endured watching this club this season, shows how far we have fallen. Thanks Boehly for successfully downgrading our status as a club and our expectations as fans.",Chelsea played like *Chelsea* for about an hour.  And I like that front line ,What is wrong with our Manager? He made substitutions as if it was a friendly match or training match. What!,"We have fantastic players like Enzo, James, Chilwell, Thiago..etc. BUT ONE GUY SCREWED UP EVERYTHING. EVERY TIME. AND TODD BOEHLY NEVER REALIZES THAT",This manager won't take us anywhere ,"Potter had to release Mudryk and catch the opponent on quick counterattacks.  That's when there was space and free zones where Mudryk would run like a rocket.  That is how it should be used, that is its value.","That's Potter's mid-table club mentality. If it was a mid-table club, it'd be normal for them to hang onto a 1 goal lead. But this is Chelsea. He is not Chelsea quality. Terrible substitutions.",Just like to thank the realised head groundsman and his son for decades of fantastic work and to wish them both all the best!!!%%%%%%,"GP still doesn't know how to make the right substitutions, it's really sad to end with a draw","Let's be honest, the players have a level of understanding with each other by now. If we brought in a top class coach next season it won't take him long to get us running. Potter just isn't cut out for managing a top club. We can't even dominate a game against relegation teams. Disgusting","We can't give more time to the manager,he is so outrageous.","Am happy for Joa Felix, he finally scored",Not gonna lie that loss at the last minute wow got me speechless we almost had the gap reduced chance to hit top 5 with some teams drawing,"Potter came from a mid - level team and made us a mid - level team. Change my mind ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇ. We need a top - tier manager who has proven himself. Ancelotti, Mourinho, for example. I miss the era of Tuchel so much. I hope he comes back. Nothing against Potter, all our fans were supportive of him for quite a long time, but things just do not work out. We lost our champion mentality. We park the bus at 1 - 0. Where is the team that played like it was their last game? Come on blues!!!!!","Mudryk played well last Game no where to be found, madueke could have made a light something absent, you remove pulisic for Gallagher, Zaharia could have fitted well in this game absent, whatever potter is using for him to still be around I don‚Äôt know, if we play like this against Liverpool, Real Madrid, Arsenal we are finished","lovely first goal at stamford bridge for jo√£o, and an ice cold penalty from kai ",What a match ,Posso morrer por esse clube,"Immediately I saw Havertz directing his celebration towards Pickford after scoring the penalty, I sensed it would come back to hunt Chelsea and I wasn't wrong",When he changed Kovacic and Fofana i knew that we could lose this game,Everything he touch turn to goals indeed.,Felix is a brilliant player I most def wanna see folks in Chelsea for longer seasons,Not the best from the blues but we move on with life Stay Strong‚öΩÔ∏è

Big ups to them.
Chelsea,kxvM3fMg2jY,What a performance from Ben Chilwell. So underrated person. Last three games Chelsea won were when Ben is on fire. My favourite player in current team,The pass from enzo to kai havertz is absolutely tremendous to be honest,"Enzo Fernandez is world class, not many players come to the league at a young age and lead a side every game with such maturity, his passing range is ridiculous! Played so calm and smooth",Love how Kova pointed to Mudryk for the assist when he scored. Love to see how his teammates supporting him to regain his confidence,Mudryk was great got an assist had a goal taken off because of offside he was a constant threat made good runs and passes overall good performance,Kovacic doesn't score ordinary goals ,That pass from Enzo and the cool finish from Kai is simply outstanding,"Great performance, unlucky for Mudryk to not have scored but he played well. Enzo really is a gem of a player, superb assist for Kai‚Äôs goal!","3 good results in a row, hopefully this team has turned a corner and can start building momentum now","No one is talking about how with two more assists, Enzo meets Jorginho's all high season record. He arrived in January btw.. My starboy‚≠ê",That beautiful assist and fantastic finish between Enzo and Kai is extremely beautiful,What a performance. Also need to give credit to Connor for that goal line block . Up the Chels ,"Kai has come in for a lot of criticism lately but he alone has kept the spirit of Chelsea alive during this difficult period. His determination and effort is what Chelsea are all about, I hope there is a place for him going forward.",Fofana is the perfect centre back for us. He deserves to continue starting for the rest of the season. What a player and great win from the blues ,This is the Chelsea we love... I hope we maintain this attitude ‚ò∫Ô∏è,Enzo vision is what we have been missing. Chilwell is a class above others. Fofana is a starter. Love felix but the post loves him more. Great streak we feel good!!!,"Enzo is literally world class man, them passes are just tremendous, the team played really well ‚ù§Ô∏è","Enzo, what a player. Controlling midfield in a PL match and he's only 22. He is the closest player to Fabregas so far. The future looking good...","Team made me so happy today. 
Couple of disallowed goals that may have stood for other teams 
But we still scored 3 undisallowed. So good one. 
Nice to see us winning games.","Chukuemeka's cameo in the final minutes was so enjoyable to watch. How he drives with the ball in midfield before he was fouled, just lovely . We have a great talented player, I just hope he gets more minutes now",All 4 goals were worth watching today ,"many of our players on fire in this game, but for this game especially i have to give major appreciation to kai again and enzo  what an assist by enzo to havertz for the goal!! chilly with a lovely little goal and kova with that scissor kick goal was class‚Ä¶ still room for improvement but another step in the right direction  good subs by potter and he definitely got it right today, good win and effort from the boys, COYB ",What a sublime pass from Enzo Fernandez.....Chelsea is back,Enzo's pass to Kai was all he needed to score. Also the last few games we see another Chilwell. Incredible performance from him,Fernandez could be our new Fabregas. Such a lovely ball to Havertz for the second goal. When Chilwell plays Chelsea do well. He's easily one of our best players. Let's hope we can keep him. Mudryk and Madueke are going to be golden over the next few years. Watch them both next season. Incredible talents. Cucurella gets a lot of stick but with good management I think he'll become a Chelsea favourite. One good greedy striker like Diego Costa and this team could challenge again on all fronts. And I wouldn't swap Potter for anyone. He's strong. And he's going to lead us to another championship if we all get behind him. Allez les bleus! Love you always and forever...no matter what.,Kepa has been consistently solid for some time now. Great to see him progress,Koulibaly fantastic. What's a player!,Mudryk so unlucky but is adopting....I hope his time comes coz he is such a dynamic player and dangerous on counter attacks.....,Fantastic goals today!

I understand in post Roman era, things are different, and some for good, but there is a limit guys. We CANNOT lose to bottom of the league-no manager-southampton (no disrespect, i thought they still had more structure than us). Potter has lost the plot. I hope the new owners have the guts that Roman had. Think we need good old Gus to steady the ship again for the third time. I think all Chelsea fans would love to see him. Because now Potter cannot go on.","Give Potter more time, until we are relegated","I feel like Havertz is at the root of us not sticking chances away, never feel like he has settled at Chelsea. D Fofana is awesome on the ball and he has the passion, get him game time. 

I was super excited after Mudryk's first game, but seems too desperate to impress so gives the ball away constantly. Keep playing, he will be ace.

J Felix is just ace. I hope so much that he and Mount become an unbeatable force.

We seem to play well when R Loftus-Cheek plays, he always looks forwards and is excellent on the ball.

Enzo seems pretty solid, but Fabregas would have produced more end product by now.

Badiashile looks pretty solid to me, pretty good with the ball.

Love Gallagher's passion when he comes on, and we have missed Sterling.

I miss Tuchel."
Chelsea,7Y7iwtU6dHE,that Adeyemi goal was insane. And the backflip afterwards. What a beast!,Very good saves from their keeper.,"As a real atleti fan (not the one who still supports the cholo..) Joao has no problem at all with the finish. He was playing 50 yards from goal every game and has 2-3 maximum shots per game, now he will have the opportunity to be a real threat offensively.. He will regain his confidence and then his real joy of playing. This guy knows everything, just the Cholo broke him but didn't destroy him.",That reverse back flip was fire ngl,The boys played well for the first time this year,What's crazier is that Adeyemi did a backflip while running forward...,"A beautiful shot, a beautiful goal and Enzo collapsed",Man am i Real Proud of this Team ! Even with current situation and the season that hasn't gone what we expected they still are able to switch the focus on the UCL and produce a real proper performance and enough chances to get that win or goals against one of the current leading germany teams in Bundesliga.

But it was Dortmund's day.,"Great goal, the control from the pass was perfect, set up his entire run","We played exceptionally well for some reason, just very unlucky that no forward is clinical enough.

Hopefully with the 3 weeks time we have before second leg, the team can gel and actualy start playing like this every single matches from now on, but with better finishing. We created so many dangerous chances and hope we can convert it next matches.","Potter had us playing free flowing football for the first time since Sarri. We just need a good striker, and Havertz is not it.",Ziyech was on fire ,Mudryk is a great player though and I love him but his first touch is very b√†d very bad just too far from good and the fact that he is a forward won't help us if he doesn't work on it as asap. The most stupidest and annoying thing is that Harvertz will still be the Striker in line up against the saints on Saturday. It will very devastating if that happens again. That is when I will confirm that this Coach is not a serious coach that mean business handling this club like an Everton club.,Good to see James getting back to his best ,Wat a manager we have keep it on blues ,OMG one guy predicted this exact score. How does he do it? It's amazing.,"Hakim is just so such a special player, just wow. And J√£o Felix, what a baller.

The Enzo assist was amazing as well.","What a humble guy the ref is, letting West Hand play with two goalkeepers ",I really don't understand why Potter subbed Mudryk out and then let Chilly in. Those two should be playing together!,I waited weeks to see Enzo and Felix play and they immediately connect in their first match together. That's the biggest positive.,"I'm a man u fan, and really don't like Chelsea, but that no penalty call by VAR is insane, the guy saved it like a keeper","*Mudryk: I'm waiting for a pass*
*Cucurella:*","Enzo is a great match! he controls the movement of the team very well, but the players need to play more with each other, and also work hard in training, let's remember how many newcomers need time. Felix with the first goal for the Blues",Cucurella have one of the fastest winger on his flank and not once did a play a ball to him everytime backwards or sideways I just don¬¥t understand it. James and Noni looked pretty good on the other flank but stand out performance was Enzo and Felix.,That enzo pass and that split second decision by felix is what chelsea need every game,"What an assist from Enzo Fern√°ndez, pure class by the world champion ",The signings are great. Now we need a manager.,Poor result but good to see Felix and Enzo connection. Mudryk deserves to play alongside Chilly so when Chilly is fully fit the left flank will be as strong as the right flank. Especially when Chilly is fully fit. But Chelsea need a top quality manager to manage this squad. Potter is sadly out of his depth,Cucurella generally ignored a partner on the flank.  Misha could try to break into the penalty area with speed and dribbling.  And so he had only to gnaw the ball.  Cucurella and Potter out,Enzo is worth every penny ,"Not a chelsea fan, but how that was not a penalty is beyond me!!!",What a assist by Enzo Farnandes!,Cucurella might be the worst attacking left back I have ever seen. Does nothing but pass back to the other defenders.,Enzo and Felix what a duo!!!,"Great assist from Enzo Fern√°ndez and great finishing from Jo√£o F√©lix.

Absolute ballers,"James is such a delight to watch with the ball at her feet and one of the best in the women's game at the moment. Great to see that through ball from her for Fran Kirby's goal , Kirby is the one that normally supplies the killer pass for the others. What with Kerr's predatory goal scoring instincts , Kirby's play making and James's ball skills the front end of this team is scary. This team when on top form makes football worth watching , more so than the men's of late. There is so much talent across several teams now that apart from giving Weigman a selection headache our chances of a women's world cup win looks more and more likely. I played for several teams when younger as most boys did and followed football as my chosen sport ever since but this Chelsea women's side is the one I look forward to watching the most.","‚ÄúKerr-boom!‚Äù

You could see his eyes roll when he was asked about Erling Haaland! As good as Erling is Julian is not playing second-fiddle to Haaland, he's a worldie striker in his own right. City have and need 2 worldie strikers. 

Julian is tailor-made for the Premier League, strong as a bull, turns on a sixpence, probably suffers few match-missing injuries and will make a significant difference in those stubborn 0-0's at Crystal Palace and Leeds.

His pace really is scary. Look at both his goals. The acceleration is insane. When I saw the first goal live, I thought he wouldn't get the ball the moment it was played, but a second later I saw big man bearing down on Areola and gets a penalty. I feel even as a fan I'm not used to seeing this from City, considering the past few seasons.
People were saying how he scored against Bundesliga teams that didn't sit deep. Bro. The dude had like 6-7 meters from outside of the penalty box, chasing a ball running away from him, and he still got it. I think he will do amazing.
Overall, I think this game perfectly demonstrated what Haaland brings to City. A pacey, clinical striker, unafraid to run and cause chaos in the opponent's backline. His current developed style perfectly suits what City needs in attack. This game, however, also demonstrated that City hasn't fully implemented that style into their system yet. Evident by a lot of missed/ignored runs.
Obviously not every single run needs a through ball, but I feel that if even some of these options were explored, he would've had a hat-trick.",Damnnn.. i remembered his debut at dortmund and he also scored and now his debut he scored TWO goals on his debut.. what a crazy player!,What a time to be a City fan (From a United fan )

Helped the team a lot, played for the team.","That early pass which Foden didn't give you Haaland but instead opted to shoot straight at the keeper's body. That would have been Haaland's first goal at the Etihad. But knowing Erling as we do,  this is just motivation for him. City still won,  but now we have an angry Haaland on our hands as well. I feel sorry for the next opponents.",What a start  proud of our boys KDB on fire,"I thought that KDB was gonna pass to Haaland, I bet that's what everyone expected too. So he took advantage and took the shot, took everyone off guard.","Haaland's assist was something else. 2 players were on him.

What a player,This game reminded me of our first leg against Real Madrid last season. A game where we could've killed off the opponent but still ending up with a disappointing result. Walker could've easily passed the ball to Haaland and he'd have an entire game to shoot. I think Mahrez also could've done better at that last shot.

The way he shields the ball and tucking it around the corner for his teammates and him physically holding off challenges and finding his teammates in good scoring areas is wonderful to watch that pass he gave to de bruyne in the second have could have been the killer goal but sadly de bruyne agonisingly missed it
And one other thing about haaland is him being in areas no one think he will be he's just always at the right place at the right time
And unlike most of the players even if he falls to the ground he gets up and gets back into his area in a blink of an eye
The way he got back in a scoring position after physically holding the ball in his stride and passing it to his teammate and literary falling down to the ground
I just couldn't believe my eyes how  he got into the box when walker recived the ball  
It felt like he was there the whole time but that's just how ridiculously quick he is","I find it interesting that Erling used his feet to direct it into the net. Given how high it looked when he made contact, most other players would have headed it in.

What a guy,"What you'll love to Haaland is he refused to celebrate the Goal, respect for his former Club. Great game! King of Comebacks!","I'm a United fan, but what Haaland does from match to match is absolutely amazing. His demeanor after that insane goal was really nice and respectful, the way he honored his old team.","Dude why were all 3 (yes including the Dortmund goal) goals so sick. An incredible pick out by the Dortmund player to redirect the shot, a screamer by Stones, and Haaland somehow getting his leg to bend like a contortionist. What a game!",Haaland is unstoppable bro. So sick.,a great sportsman who didn't celebrate scoring against his old club....RESPECT,"I don‚Äôt want to rush things or get over excited but Haaland is really going places, what a start for his City career the guy is absolutely amazing","Really can't get over this! The Stones rocket shot, the Cancelo beautiful assist, the Haaland super finishing. Love my blue lads ","Haaland‚Äôs humbleness after scoring a goal against his former team was a magnificent display of sportsmanship, and for him to go and hug his former teammates after the match further proves that. Haaland‚Ä¶ WHAT A BEAST OF A FOOTBALLER! City may be in with a change to get the triple this year‚Ä¶ maybe even the quad!",Time after time Manchester City has shown that they may fall but wont yield. Stones goal reminds me of Kompany's screamer and Haaland's goal was just something innate...u cant teach that in practice. ‚öΩÔ∏è,That Stones goal was so unexpected I screamed at the top of my lungs and it was around 3:00 AM at my place ,"The way Halland didn't celebrate his goal and after the match, went to his former teammates and give them some small talk and hugs is just a real feel good moment. Truly a machine on the pitch and a human off of it. Bless this young man.",Haaland Goal is so underrated... 1 out of 99 strikers in the PL will not even  try something like that let along score goal from 9 feet in the air....haaland the alien is just unreal,Everyone talking about the haaland goal but that assist from cancelo needs some appreciationü•µ,Rodri's reaction to Haaland's goal ,"Haland scores a phenomenal goal, he is about to go buttshit insane but last second he remembers that he kinda owes this team his entire career so he remained respectful.

Glad to see him make his way.,"Both assist and goal are magical..Not many player can make a trivela assist like cancelo did..And for sure, I think only Haaland (and ibrahimovic) can make that absolute acrobatic kick goal..ManCity are lucky to have both of them..","The introductions of: Foden, Alvarez, Bernardo Silva changed the tempo of the game, much better than Mahrez, Gundo and Grealish to be honest. I loved the way the team reacted after the conceded goal, a magical bullet shot from Stonesy and a typical Joao Cancelo outside of the foot cross master pass alongside a wonderful neck height strike from Haaland to get us the 3 points in a game where the opposition were defending very very well, until the last 20-25 min of the game when the team finally exploited their defence. By the way I must say both Grealish and Mahrez really haven't been on it at all this season, Grealish can't take on defenders like he used to at Villa, meanwhile Mahrez who's known for his dribbling capabilities doesn't even bother to do that anymore, he plays back passes for majority of the game, Cancelo completes more successful dribbles than all of our wingers, and that's concerning not gonna lie.. Our front trio should always be: Foden / Haaland / Alvarez, they're the difference makers and the hungrier players, now lets hope for a win in the match vs Wolves away from home and come back home to Manchester with all 3 points .","The finish was truly inspired, but the pass from Cancelo was sublime",‚ÄúYou just feel if city can get 1 they‚Äôll get 2‚Äù,Both assist and finish were insane,"What an assist , what a goal","As a Liverpool fan, there is no other player in the world that can score that goal apart from Haaland.","Haaland‚Äôs goal was amazing!

This guy will break records.","I have 2 things to say:
1. Haaland is inevitable ü•π
2. Foden is outstanding ","As a Liverpool fan, and Haaland just unbelieveable",That assist from De Bruyne was amazing.,"Best thing about Haaland is his humbleness and no bulls**t play style despite being such a beast and instinctive scorer! And he is such a team player!
Kudos to the manager too for creating plays not just around Haaland which allows the team's offense to flow.","Damn it, KDB's assist to Haaland. Even us as a spectator would be surprise of such vision. What a crazy through pass. Easily the best playmaker in the world right now, KDB...

Edit: I watched it over and over again. At 0:24 most of us would probably expect him to pass the ball to the RW and yet he bend the ball like crazy to Haaland. Pure sickness.","We all know Haaland can score goals, but his passing is so underrated.","Silva does a lot of run-around-the-pitch kinda ""dirty"" jobs... he covers most areas and attacks as well as defend. You almost never see him coming until he builds up an attack or assists at the defence line. SILVA IS UNDERRATED! AN UNSUNG HERO HE IS!!","Haaland 3 goals 2 assists
Foden 3 goals
KDB 2 assists
This is City masterclass",What I love about Haaland is as well as scoring he's delighted for his teammates too when they nick in for one (or 3 in fodens case) absolutely fantastic they were......from a Barnsley fan ‚úåÔ∏è,"What a redemption from Erling to his father!

","Haaland, Foden, King De Bruyne, Akanji,  Aki & Bernado all amazing today. Grealish playing more direct which was great to see , every player did their job well.","I like how Haaland falls down after putting Foden through for his last goal, but he‚Äôs instantly up again and looking for the rebound if he doesn‚Äôt score.","People thought Haaland would be good at Salzburg, the man turned out to be amazing. They thought he would be amazing at Dortmund. He turned out to be world class. At City people thought he would be world class. He turns out to be galaxy level. The fact that he still exceeds excpectation is crazy.

- Coming from a LIverpool fan ","Una de las cosas que m√°s me agrada de Haaland es que festeja los goles de los compa√±eros como si fueran suyos. Eso habla del tremendo compa√±ero que es.
No como ""otros"" que si no meten el gol ellos, hacen berrinche.","Anybody noticed most of Haaland's goals are acrobatic in nature? Man's got so much energy to slide, fly/jump, run, just do something to push the ball into the net!!  ü§£  EPL isn't so hard after all!!","Can't deny Haaland has crazy talent, if he keeps this up and stays away from the highs of being a footballer the sky is the limit.","Foden had Malacia in his pocket, the sprint just before his second goal from his own box and outpaced Malacia is pure athleticism.",What a brilliant and unforgettable game here!ü§©,That last Foden goal and Haaland assist. Haaland fell after he passed the ball to Foden and got back up in less than a second and began running towards goal all after he just scored a hat trick. This dude is a beast.,"I may just be overreacting cause I'm still hyped from the match, but that may have been the best attacking football I've ever seen from City, especially in the first half! And while Haaland and Foden were obviously out of this world, they could attack freely because every single other player was firing at 100%. De Bruyne with his beautiful assists, Gundogan dependable as ever as holding midfielder, Grealish becoming more dangerous every game with his dribbling, Akanji proving to be the best bargain ever, and of course my man Bernardo Silva, the silent genius.",Haaland is incredible.

Well done Phil and Erling!,"Both KBD assist to haaland, and Haaland assist to foden are amazing","This is about the 10th time I‚Äôve watched this - in my opinion the best game  of football I‚Äôve ever seen.

Add goals..... you are really improving and a delight to watch","Nathan Jones

I was actually sad to learn that Southampton had sacked Nathan, but as a Luton Town supporter, it was almost inevitable from the moment your board first showed interest in him. I‚Äôm not just saying that as sour grapes neither.
Financially, there was a clause in his contract that had Nathan done well at Southampton and saved them from relegation, we at Luton would have received an amount of money as a result.
For a club on a very limited budget, any cash-back would have been greatly appreciated, however, as he was manager at our club for several seasons, we at Luton know the way NJ operates.

When he first came to us we were in League Two, knocking on the door of the play-offs but not quite crossing that line. Nathan came in and promised us he was building a team that would be good enough to play in the Championship. He also compared us to teams like Northampton and Portsmouth who were doing well in League Two at that time; teams which he pointed out, that had been together as a group for a number of seasons. In that comment, you have the basic mindset of Nathan Jones. 
He was never going to go into Southampton and turn their fortunes around. He is not that kind of manager. That‚Äôs why he failed at Stoke. It wouldn‚Äôt matter if they are bottom of the Premier League or League Two, he is a long-term builder not a short-term fire-fighter.
If there are any ambitious League One or League Two clubs, they should snap him up. He could actually work wonders at a team like Wrexham, and it wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if he turns up there one day in the coming years.

I have to say I was greatly pissed off at Chris Sutton‚Äôs comments on the BBC last week. I can understand Saints supporters being annoyed at Nathan‚Äôs comments following the Brentford defeat, and I could have understood had the board dealt with the matter then. They have that right as they pay the season tickets or pay the wages. But Chris Sutton shouldn‚Äôt be using his podcast to suggest to anyone that your club sack their manager. Personally, I believe Nathan was really feeling the pressure of the situation and maybe he was beginning to realise how big a task he had got himself into. To be fair to him, neither Gerrard or Lampard did much better and they can claim to have some Premier league experience as players, if nothing else.
But Chris Sutton is typical of the arrogant ‚Äòpundits‚Äô who call themselves experts. What makes him an expert? He spent one season as manager at Lincoln and lost twice as many games as he won. He seems to have set himself up as the Simon Cowell of football punditry, and doesn‚Äôt miss an opportunity to criticise one manager or another, or whichever player meets with his disapproval. But he doesn‚Äôt have to make the decisions by which he will be judged. Managers live or die by the decisions that they make. In this case, Nathan has paid the price. Maybe he should consider sitting in some warm studio and getting paid shed-loads for doing f*ck-all but watching a tv screen.",Sulemena what a speed ü´°,"How on earth have Saints lost this?

Passing was substandard, just giving the ball away constantly. Our 1 striker always halfway done the pitch, never a threat up top, and on the counter, barely any effort to get up the pitch by attacking players. No out ball from defensive corners means the ball is always recycled back by the other team and we are constantly pinned in our own half.

Playing 6 defensive players plus goalie and leaking 3 goals, what a joke. Can‚Äôt defend and can‚Äôt score.

4-4-2 please, play narrower, stop using strikers as defenders and start the new signings on. Elyounoussi, Diallo, Che Adams, Bednarek can all make way. There is literally nothing to lose now, the old players don‚Äôt have the ability nor hunger to make a difference.","How can you have one of the best technical dribblers & not start him wtf, did you see what he did to Uruguay in the World Cup","The SFC Consortium brought in Jones on the cheap and they know this.

As a liverpool fan it's frustrating to see a good result and next we are back to trying to improve again. I do hope we work on the psychological effect first, especially for the second time we have seen trent trying to go all out chasing and pressing the goal keeper without avail, leaving him with his hands up signaling a sign of frustration with the overall team performance that include himself. I dont think anyone wont shy away from taking the responsibility. This season could actually teach us that most of the teams are getting better and we have to prepare ourselves and analyze our opponent's weaknesses just like how they explore ours. We are basically out of every competition and that gives us our chance to try to win every game without any other distraction. Fine tuned the mentality and we will get there sooner or later. YNWA"
Liverpool,bb25lIUkTgI,"Was a tough watch simply because the whole team bar Alisson looked like they just didn't care/believe. We used to pride ourselves on our immaculate mentality and this season has seen a ridiculous drop off in that department. Praying that we fix up next season because losing is one thing, but losing whilst not even putting in 100% effort is not acceptable for a club this size.","For the avoidance of doubt, the YNWA played at Estadio Santiago Bernab√©u after the final whistle was in exchange for the tribute that LFC paid to our old legend Amancio Amaro in the first leg played in Anfield. No mocking at all. All the stadium stood there applauding. Real Madrid and LFC are two of the most legendary and traditional football clubs in the world and I guess the respect is reciprocal. We both represent the football that should prevail over the oil-state funded clubs.

Hope you come back stronger than ever LFC, YNWA.

Hala Madrid!","We looked small against Real Madrid, their midfielders controlled the field,  while we didn't have any midfielders.

It seems like they know our playstyle and tactics better than our players do!,"Sadly our defense (specifically VVD, TAA) and all the midfielders were performing badly throughout the 90 minutes! There was no urgency, bad passes and so much time wasting!",Alisson has been our best player this season thank you Ali,"Class from Madrid to play YNWA at full time, was done to say thank you to Liverpool for the beautiful gesture by the club, Kenny and Billy Hogan when honorary Madrid president Amancio Amaro passed the day of the first leg.

-Proper, defensive minded RB to compete w/ Trent
-CB to keep Joe Gomez out of the team until he gets his decision making right
-2 to 3 midfielders for Milner, Hendo & Thiago since they‚Äôve not got 90 minutes in their legs.","RM was simply better let's admit it. Modric, Benzema, Kroos, Rudiger etc. were just sensational. Too bad for Liverpool which I am a great fan of. In both games I did not see that fighting spirit and self- confidence they showed against ManU; it was almost like they were switched off. This could only negatively impact their collective performance, both technically and creatively.",Hope the team picks themselves up and fights for top 4.

 Just throwing a couple of thoughts out there but what about using Tsimikas as a RB aswell as LB cover.. Games like this where Trent isn't at 100% would be perfect for him in my opinion plus doubles up his potential game time too.
Hendo should start, he really set's the tone and if needed, rotate later on into the game not the other way around when chasing the game. Just my observations..
 Mostly though..... Screw early kick offs...  
 Onto the next one.... ‚ù§",The goal wasn't the only difference.  Bournemouth also had the desire and intensity to want to win the game.

However Liverpool‚Äôs campaign this season is already a write-off. The best we can hope for is a Champions League spot.

This is what the reds have been missing all season, but its never too late :)","The thing to note about this great team performance and win was, when the chance to shoot came, they took it, salah's goals were quick reaction shots, this has been lacking in so many games for Liverpool this season,  trying to walk the ball into the net is pointless,  literally,  when the chance to shoot is in front of you, take it, football is easy if you follow 3 simple rules,

Liverpool versus Manchester United, a clash of titans, fiercely excited. But what transpired was beyond belief: United's defense torn like a leaf, seven goals - each one a hammer blow, a humiliation, a devastating blow. The first goal came like a bolt from the blue - Gakpo's strike leaving United askew, then Nunez added a second with glee - a rout in progress for all to see. The third goal, Gakpo's, was pure class - United's defense a complete bypass. Then Salah scored with ease, the crowd roaring as Liverpool did please. As the game wore on, United's hopes sank. Liverpool scored again with a shot so dank. Salah, the hero of the night; United's defense, a pitiful sight. Two more goals just to add salt to the wound - a crushing defeat, United were marooned. Their fans in shock, the players in dismay, a night to forget, a bitter display.

For Liverpool, it was a night to remember - a crushing victory, a victory so tender. For United, it was a night to forget - a humbling experience, one they'll regret.","Love the revival of Liverpool .

The true MOTM","‚ÄúIf you can't win, don't lose"" - Jurgen Klopp","Playing Milner and Henderson for 90 minutes was the biggest mistake in my opinion. 70% possesion, one of them is enough. Elliot was great when he came on. Always looking forward and made some nice crosses and passes. The quality isn't always there but atleast he's trying and wanna go forward. Henderson and Milner are too defensive and not creative enough in such a high possesion game. Kind of felt like we were happy with a draw today and that sucks considering what this team has achievied but I know things will turn around soon.","Great chances from Salah and Jota

Everyone plays better especially Salah who gets more goals when Jota's on the pitch.

Terrible shame opposing teams target him and that is why he's had so many injuries.

Combined with the loss of Mane, this problem has become huge.","Feeling Sad right now for our club, but we must persevere through this guys","I really miss the trio of Mane, Salah, Firmino ü•∫",As a Eest Ham fan it breaks my heart to see Dawson scoring in different colours!! What a player he was for us,The absence of Sadio Mane is now being felt.,"The way we are playing right now feels like we are a Championship club that just got promoted and now can't keep up to the big boys. The lack of additions over the last 2/3 years has led to where we are right now. We all knew a few years ago this style of play will kill players sooner than later and we did not freshen up the squad enough.  Tough times ahead.  The sooner the sale happens, the sooner we can start the rebuild.  Quad to this, wow.",The departure of Sadio Mane has a huge impact on the team's performance. The team struggled to maintain good performance,Mane was the head and heart  of the team,"Honestly, I think Liverpools performance this season was to be expected. They took every competition to the final day last season, those guys were gassed at the end of it and you could tell by the pre-season games that they were still recovering both mentally and physically. 

I can see this happening to my mags next season too.",Super play again from Liverpool. Hope they continue to perform like this for the next few games. Awesome team play !,"As a liverpool fan, I'm so sad for our team i hope in the future we can get better performance","This season is worse than 20/21. We need to turn something around. When we are losing like this and our best option off the bench is James Milner, we won‚Äôt change anything. We need better reinforcements.","The season ended the very first game with the draw to Fulham. Just looking at how we played, you can tell how outdated our tactics were. Never understood why Klopp doesn't want to try a new formation or approach for each match. The defeat of Bournemouth was a fluke. The injuries to Jota and Diaz is tragic. We need to give both Nunez and Gakpo time to fully adjust to the EPL and hope they can improve next season. We should have sold Salah in the summer and hanged on to Mane for another season or two. With the money from Salah's sale, we could have bought 2 midfielders. I'll continue to support and watch the matches but I honestly feel we'll probably finish the the season out of any European competitions. I'd give Doak, Bajectic, Ramsey, Carvalho, Phillips more play time since our season is done for, let them all get experience. A major overhaul is due, get rid of Ox, Keita, Gomez, and those with higher wages and in their 30's. Time to restart. Well done to Wolves yesterday, deserved to win the game.",Feels like we‚Äôve been on the downfall now for awhile   But I can‚Äôt help but to still love Klopp,"Counter-intuitively, Salah is most effective when he is NOT the most dangerous attacking threat in the team. We are missing Luis Diaz... Jota.. (and Sadio..<3!) and perhaps most importantly.. Bobby. Klopp's inability to re-invent his side shows, as much as I love him as a coach.. Guardiola is miles ahead in this aspect. 
Maybe LFC could finish the season with Pep Linderjs and have Klopp return at the start of next season..? Because he definitely does not deserve this type of a send-off if that is going to be the case.","Before the injuries, Salah and Nunez were good, but when the players got injured, the midfield and defense became weak, this affected our strikers.","¬øPor qu√© se dejaron golear? Realmente fue un partido muy f√°cil para el adversario,creo que si no cambian de actitud,van a terminar muy mal.
Desear√≠a verles ganar todo el tiempo,pero no quieren poner de su parte,es muy lamentable. ",Oh boy those first 15 minutes in second half really brought back some good old memories. The rest of the game was unbearable.,"You can‚Äôt just replace Sadio mane, he‚Äôs presence is greatly needed in this team",Says a lot when this is the 2nd best performance all season. ,Defeat is an understatement...
Liverpool,1FCnbn6Fsdk,"That Mitoma goal is another level. Respect to Brighton. We are quite bad this year, but gotta respect quality when you see it. If Mitoma were English, media would be valuing him at ¬£60-80m",Mitoma is amazing. what a dribbler. what a baller.,That goal was insane. He first took a beautiful touch. That was cool. The really baffling part was the second touch. He had a fast enough reaction to take a second touch to avoid deflection and score a volley from there. Astounding.,Damn that Mitoma guy is a really good dribbler I'll be watching Brighton games as well now,"Mitoma, UNSTOPPABLE!!!!!",To be honest that mitoma goal is out of this world but how could we not win against Brington in their current state this probably disappoint me more than the loses we have ,That has to be a Goal of the Year nominee. Amazing!!!,The intensity of Mitoma goal is incredible,"This is simply heart breaking...
We'll continue to stand by the scousers but it sucks to see them suffer loss after loss...","Last season almost winning quadruple, this season almost nothing. Tough times with injuries and all. Hope the squad and fans will be mentally strong. YNWA",came to rewatch this mitoma goal after episode 20 of blue lock its the exact same as nagis goal,"When Taki was kicked out, Mitoma promised him to take revenge",Mitoma best goal...,"After Diaz got injured the team just broke down and everything progressed from bad to worse. It's sad how we went from title challengers into a mid table tier team this season. Letting players go without buying replacements is really our downfall because injuries do happen and squad depth is crucial against that. I think we should just let this season go, it's just sad that we might miss out on the UCL this year and the following one.","As a Japanese Liverpool fan, I think we need Taki back again!!!","I am Japanese. As a Liverpool supporter and a supporter of the Japan national team, I was overjoyed when Mitoma scored.  However, when I realized the reality of losing the FA Cup, my face turned like this. (‡πë-Ôπè-‡πë)",So we've come from staying alive for each trophy till the end last season to getting out of 3 competitions before the Champions League R16 first leg ,ƒ∞ don't care what happened. ƒ∞ still love Liverpool and Klopp ,"Honestly shocking, but not surprised. Brighton have been a ghost, but that wouldn't happen if the midfield were more decisive. We will not stop believing, but we urgently need creativity","Can‚Äôt believe we have fell off a cliff like this, it‚Äôs glaring the issues we have in midfield and the club have left themselves in a massive situation this summer with naby/ox leaving, Milner/hendo/Thiago a year older, a lot of money and transitioning will happen, could do with Klopp of the club giving the fans something to be hopeful for, always kept in the dark",Brighton look awesome! That Mitoma is going to be special.,Japanese ballers taking over scottish and english football ,"I'm very sad to see Liverpool lose, but I'm sure Mr. Klops will make good improvements to the Reds squad, I really hope ü•∫ü•≤",This loss is a blessing in disguise for our top 4 ambition. Remember when van dijk was injured we were almost rock bottom. So is the same here. Klopp had Diaz as an ace. One wrong pillar can collapse the entire construction. Wait till we have all our players fit. We were not so good with van dijk aswell this season but we don‚Äôt concede the winner for Brighton if he was on the pitch. Just be with us and the boss. He will turn things around. Just have faith.,"So basically we've come from singing ""We're gonna win the league"" to ""You're nothing special, we lose every week"" in a span of months",So I guess we must say welcome to Liverpool Mitoma!!,"We'll fight till the end, be it in the UCL final or relegation of championship, just like we can win everything, we can lose everything. Nothing stays the same. YNWA ","Konate's fists have always terrified Brighton's players. And he hit Mitoma, but I want you to reconsider whether it was really necessary to hit him.

1. Mitoma ‚ù§
2. Trent Alexander-Arnold 
3. Darwin N√∫√±ez "
Liverpool,btFCxfjCOUc,Oh man! What a performance by Thiago Silva at the age of 38.,Robbo always there no matter how low things get. Most consistent player in our recent history,"One season back to pre Klopp times and everyone is like, we've hit rock bottom. This is exactly where we were without Klopp. Thank the gods for Klopp we had One UCL and a PL and great reputation between it.","As a chelsea fan, I really think liverpool took what mane brought to the team for granted. Never should have let him go.","To be honest, i feel the team is very lost recently, we play alot of times without knowing what we want or how to get to it, with all respect to all players but this is not liverpool we know, we need to take a step back, analyse where our shortcomes and needs are and reforme alot, especially in player signing especially regarding midfields",This team has hit rock bottom. I don‚Äôt believe we‚Äôll be back to our old standards next season. Team needs a lot of investing and a completely different system.,"we need our boy luis diaz back, him and nunez are gonna fly","Everyone was 25-28 years old during those golden days. Now, everyone seems to be touching 30 and we just can‚Äôt cope. We either need a new play style or a new team.","I think people are forgetting that Klopp‚Äôs liverpool scraped through 1st and 2nd year. Maybe the transition is not going so ideally, especially after seeing some insane golden eras. but any team great or small suffers in transitions. Sooner or later we knew this were to happen. 

We are reaching rock bottom this season, but maybe this is the time to be patient until we see ourself back to the top.","The strong, energetic midfield of Liverpool is now old",–ú—É–¥—Ä–∏–∫ –∫—Ä–∞—Å–∞–≤–∞! –£–¥–∞—á–∏ –≤ —Å–ª–µ–¥—É—é—â–∏—Ö –∏–≥—Ä–∞—Ö!,I love Gakpo's determination.

enthusiasm for Jurgen Klopp and the players, hopefully we can bounce back soon and be at the top of the Premier league standings",Liverpool‚Äôs attack has lost much of its sharpness after the departure of Mane and that has resulted in more pressure on defence and midfield. Liverpool hardly had any meaningful attempt at Chelsea‚Äôs goal.,My man robbo. Always tries his best. That's why I love him.,"With the nunez-gapko combi, gapko didn't had a chance to see were the keeper was otherwise it was def a goal. We miss Virgil",I hope we find our form we once had again ,Klopp calculation went wrong . He thought Salah > Mane. But it‚Äôs Mane >> Salah,The performances of late have been coming from a few seasons now. Never convinced me even though we were chasing four titles last season.,Still love this team ‚ù§Ô∏è,"I really don't know why the fans are attacking Salah
Who saved Liverpool from the two toughest games against Manchester City and Tottenham, we would have seen Liverpool in 14th place
Most of Salah's goals this season are mistakes from defenders, and this is intelligence from Salah because no player assist goals for Salah, so Salah makes his own goals from the mistakes of the defenders
I am not defending Salah, but if we have to blame anyone, the whole club should be blamed",Owners are the reason Liverpool have fallen so far off this season. No  midfield player signed for four years. Klopp is not faultless. Klopp made a huge error. Replaced Mane with Nunez and Gakpo both players haven't got the Intensity to press from the front like Mane use to. Mane was also excellent at keeping hold of the ball for 5/6 seconds which in turn would relieved pressure from the other team. Now the front players aren't pressing and can't keep hold of the ball like a Mane would so it means more chances for the opposite team. A toxic environment which will take years to fix unless we get in owners who will back him. Pure Facts!,"Im not Dissapointed, Im not Mad

I feel what it is to lose and be at the position Liverpool is at, but there is still a long way nearly half the matches still remain. They need to ditch the other cup ties and focus on PL, Use the other cup ties to test out players who can readily switch to main team.

I regretfully say, Sadio Mane leaving was a big blow. With what I used to see him play, he used to be what Mitoma was today but at a higher level (like David Silva was to ManCity or KDB is to them) (no I'm not a ManCity fan, quite opposite I'm a Manchester United fan, but I have seen highs and lows so I understand) .

Everyone talking about Iwobi but I still prefers 4-4-2 with Onana n Gueye at center, Grey n Gordon at flank n Cannon n Maupay in attack until a true striker in Goykeres (1st choice) and Sarr on board. Good to see playing time given to Cannon to proves himself.",Mina is so underrated,Jose Sa is a monstrous goalkeeper,Great game . i love how Everton played  . Wolves just got very lucky at the end.

Everton,LM5IAma7SqY,funny seeing some everton fans blaming lampard when even ancelotti and rafa couldn't do much for this poor team ,"I still believe that great players don't necessarily make great coaches, so the total score with Bournemouth is 7-1 and what will happen in the next game?","Sou brasileiro e acompanho os jogos desse querido clube . Pois sempre h√° algum brasileiro por a√≠. Insistem muito em jogadores caros badalados pela m√≠dia mais que n√£o rendem em campo . Holgate , Keane , Andr√© Gomes , Tom Davies , Mina , esses tinham que sair na minha opini√£o . O goleiro √© bom os laterais s√£o bons . Doucour√© tambem √© bom jogador assim como DCL , Gordon , Mc Neil . Insistem em jogadores errados . Querendo ou nao faz muita falta Richarlisson , James Rodrigues , Sigurddsson , Digne . Rafa como t√©cnico foi uma vergonha . Aqui na Am√©rica do Sul existem muitos melhores que esses . Olhem e escolham melhor no mercado  pra n√£o fica lutando pra nao cair mais uma temporada . Saudade de ver os Brasileiros tamb√©m ","1:24 shows that Everton needs a new attacker. Onana did a good job dribbling into the box and he's cut back put the ball in a dangerous position. The problem is that Maupay has a lack of understanding of his surroundings. He should position himself far from the defenders so that he can receive the cutback, and look to score. He also didn't know Gray was in an open position. If he knew that he could have passed it to him instead of taking it out the box. All in all this is a result of his lack of special awareness. A goal scoring opportunity that I'm sure if Everton had a competent striker they could have scored","Rafa spent - 1.7m
Lampard spent - 120m

Our squad is once again weaker than last season as our board continue to sell our best players!,"As a professional footballer, I think some of our players does not deserved the high wages.

Everton,tPj5j7W0VQE,Now Everton can focus on the Champions League.,Everton‚Äôs defense ,A reminder of how terrible our centre backs were before Tarks and Coady. Might as well have put a couple of wheely bins back there.,What combinations what passes Bournemouth,Very few managers will take a risk  of  completely switching their starting XI from the last game that was played only four days back. It takes a long time and practice to set the rhythm and understanding  among the players.,"The backline needs more upgrading, they made many mistakes which led to some of the goals. It's okay, next is FA Cup and the Premier League. The frontline should also take their chances because for example in the first half they had so many chances but didn't take them. The team needs to do better.","A dreadful result that will resonate throughout the club....from Failure Farm to the Boardroom. Once again it showed our lack of quality in every area, and i include Frank in that assessment....though he is not the primary cause of concern for me. This long term problem came to a head last season, but we managed to avoid relegation by the skin of our teeth...in response to that fright we added some good players to the squad in the shape of Coady, Tarx and Onana...we also added some reasonable players in the shape of Gana and Garner...so despite results like this one, we did actually improve our defense/midfield, and under the circumstances it was not a bad introduction for Thelwell...i'll rate him on those signings as a 6. But they were not his only acquisitions....we now have Deli, Maupay and McNeil on our wage bill and it's hard for me to justify any of those signings. Playing out from the back is something i like to see a team do...but we're not very good at it...every team wants to play us in our own half, because they know we'll lose possession when they apply even the slightest pressure....remember what Benitez said ""we're not very good in possession"" so while it's a tactic it's not the only one...the long ball can be very effective if you have the forwards to take advantage of it...but we don't have those either...so what's to be done? We must attempt to bring in some goals in January but otherwise it's a case of circling the wagons...our defense can be excellent and our midfield can compete at prem level but let's not kid ourselves here....we're in a relegation scrap right now...and that's where Frank comes in....can he guide us through another flirtation with the Championship...personally i think he can...but he's on really thin ice.",4-1 Against Bournemouth!!! I was very shocked to say the least of it...,I like Bournemouth they always seen to do well against the small clubs like this. Fighters.,"The players didn't turn up and the fans need to show the same positive atmosphere that they showed last season.
It makes a huge difference..","With all due respect to Everton, today Bournemouth made this club a front yard!",Might‚Äôve been the worst Bournemouth away performance we‚Äôve put in since they came up the first time and that‚Äôs saying something,It is not a shock result when you see Keane and Holgate in the lineup. And it is good for focus on the league.,Our defence without tarky and coady is awful‚Ä¶ davies should have scored that one‚Ä¶ what a goal by gray‚Ä¶ Saturday we must win ‚Ä¶ UTFT,3 out of 4 conceded goals were from defensive errors. Hope our players learnt from the mistakes and win this weekend...,"Look, I know it was a second string side, but if we lose at the weekend more and more toffees will begin to question Frank. 
In terms of the cup itself, I know its a mickey mouse trophy but we have fallen so far in the last 30 years, the league cup is not beneath us. We need to take this and the FA cup more seriously.","Bournemouth had lost consecutive games in the league, but they were all very good.
